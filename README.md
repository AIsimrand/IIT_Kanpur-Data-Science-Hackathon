# DataScienceHackathon
### My Submission for IIT Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon Competition.

# My Task was to analyze the given weather scene. Find the reports of the weather in a graphical pattern, encode the necessary with different python tools and finally train with different machine learning tools to produce output which could serve as the target that is the same as daily summary when new data comes into play. Also to find the accuracy metrics such that the number of false positives are less than the true positives and also the accuracy is optimized
